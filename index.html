          Breeding range of penguins, all species (aqua); some species have
          wider seasonal migration ranges Penguins (order Sphenisciformes
          /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, family Spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of
          aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the southern
          hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of
          the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have
          countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most
          penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which
          they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their
          lives on land and the other half in the sea. Although almost all
          penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not
          found only in areas with cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact,
          only a few species of penguin live that far south. Several species are
          found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Galápagos penguin,
          lives near the Equator. The largest living species is the emperor
          penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[4] on average, adults are about 1.1 m
          (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species
          is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy
          penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2
          lb).[5] In general today, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, and
          smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates.
          Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an
          adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic
          regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km
          south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than
          today.[which?]

            The word penguin first appears in the 16th century as a name for the
            great auk.[6] When European explorers discovered what are today
            known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their
            similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, and
            named them after this bird, although they are not closely
            related.[7] The etymology of the word penguin is still debated. The
            English word is not apparently of French,[6] Breton[8] or Spanish[9]
            origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin
            "auk"), but first appears in English or Dutch.[6] Some dictionaries
            suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, "head" and gwyn, "white",[10]
            including the Oxford English Dictionary, the American Heritage
            Dictionary,[11] the Century Dictionary[11] and Merriam-Webster,[12]
            on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk,
            either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh: Pen Gwyn)
            in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes
            (though the head was black). An alternative etymology links the word
            to Latin pinguis, which means "fat" or "oil".[13] Support for this
            etymology can be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin,
            fettgans or "fat-goose", and the related Dutch word vetgans. Adult
            male penguins are called cocks, females are hens; a group of
            penguins on land is a waddle, and a group of penguins in the water
            is a raft.

          <h3>Pinguinus</h3>
          <div id="pinguinus">
            <p>
              Since 1871, the Latin word Pinguinus has been used in scientific
              classification to name the genus of the great auk (Pinguinus
              impennis, meaning "penguin without flight feathers"),[14] which
              became extinct in the mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004
              genetic study, the genus Pinguinus belongs in the family of the
              auks (Alcidae), within the order of the Charadriiformes.[15][16]
              The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and
              were so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to
              the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not
              auks and they are not closely related to the great auk.[7][14]
              They do not belong in the genus Pinguinus, and are not classified
              in the same family and order as the great auk. They were
              classified in 1831 by Bonaparte in several distinct genera within
              the family Spheniscidae and order Sphenisciformes.

            species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed,
            penguin biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in
            the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some sources consider the
            white-flippered penguin a separate Eudyptula species, while others
            treat it as a subspecies of the little blue penguin;[17][18] the
            actual situation seems to be more complicated.[19] Similarly, it is
            still unclear whether the royal penguin is a separate species or
            merely a colour morph of the macaroni penguin. The status of the
            rockhopper penguins is also unclear. Updated after Marples
